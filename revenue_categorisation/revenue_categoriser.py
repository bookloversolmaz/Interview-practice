from typing import List, Dict
# You're working on Liberisâ€™ internal finance data processing tool. Task is to:
# 1. Categorize each transaction based on its type and amount
# 2. Return the total amount per revenue category, rounded to 2 decimal places

# TO DO
# 1. Get the data:
# Provided data in the test
# 2. Define what to do
# Format the data:
# Iterate over list and collect each type together, ordering each into sequence below
# Take the second key/value in each dict and add the values for each type together. Can see from test that the program does not do this
# 3. Implement the action
# After interating, add each value of every data type into four results rounded to 2 decimal places:
# Loan Revenue:, Card Revenue:, Refund: -, Other:
# 4. Process the result
# The result should be in a dictionary where each data type is a separate key value pair
def categorize_transactions(transactions: List[Dict]) -> Dict[str, float]:
    # TODO: Implement logic here
    loan_revenue = 0
    card_revenue = 0
    refund = 0
    other = 0

    return {

        "Card Revenue": 0.0,
        "Refund": 0.0,
        "Other": 0.0
    }
# Test results:
# Sample input: does not ouput info in correct format, assertion error
# Negative card amount:
